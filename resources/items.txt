If not getting the intended parsing results make sure things are spelled correctly and
use the (ITEM) header instead of the (START). . . .wasted a good hour figuring that one out.

ITEMletter
DESCRIPTION
There is a tattered worn down letter.
Incoherent scribbles cover the page.
ENDDESCRIPTION

EX
Upon further inspection the letter reads:
    They kept coming.
    Late into the night creatures from all around, blood drooling from their mouths,
    kept coming. The moans and groans of these lifeless creatures are too loud to sleep.

    To survive the night, put furniture, items, anything in front of the door.
    When you think you have enough fortifications, type sleep while in the room.
    Keep them out. Or else. . . .
The letter abruptly transforms into indecipherable scribbles then ends.
I wonder what happened to them.
